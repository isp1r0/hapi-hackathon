Hapi Hackathon
==============

Boilerplate Hapi Web and API Server Example

## The Goal:
Create a base boilerplate example showing how easy it is to get started with Hapi as a web server.

## The Stack:
**Node.js** - Because it's fast, easy to get started, and Javascript is awesome.
[http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/)

**Hapi** - A very well designed server framework that is easy to understand, easy to create your own plugins, scales very well, cache options built in, and more.

**Swig** - It looks like HTML, it's very fast, great for template inheritance, and allows you to use HTML syntax with the server and with front-end client Javascript includes.

### Requirements:
Install Node.js by using the big install button on the [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/) homepage.

After Node.js is installed, clone this repo, change `cd` to this directory, and run `npm install`

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/truong/hapi-hackathon.git
$ cd hapi-hackathon
$ npm install
```

Start the server by running the command:
```
$ node server
```

To see any changes you can manually just shutdown and restart the node server. This can be a pain so I use Supervisor to watch for file changes and restart the server [https://github.com/isaacs/node-supervisor](https://github.com/isaacs/node-supervisor).

To install run:
```
$ npm install -g supervisor
```

To use it run:
```
$ supervisor -e html,js  server
```

Now all of your server html and js files are being watched and on change the node server gets restarted automatically.

#### Folder Structure
There are two main folders in the stack. The "**public**" folder for front-end (client side) code, and "**server**" folder for server side code.

By having the front-end folder and server side folder be specific, it provides for better consistency when changing projects. This way when you change from a full front-end app (Phonegap), to a front-end and server side app you get to keep the same folder structure. Allowing for better consistency with your stack, projects, and tools.
